## - **Data Types**

```
 All data types: ***I Float, Clearly Don't Byte Short Long, Double. String!***


int:
Use for whole numbers without decimal points.
Example: int age = 25;


float:
Use for floating-point numbers with moderate precision.
Example: float temperature = 98.6f;

char:
Use for a single character.
Example: char grade = 'A';

boolean:
Use for variables that can have only two values: true or false.
Example: boolean isRaining = true;

byte:
Use when memory conservation is critical or when working with raw binary data.
Example: byte data = 120;

short:
Use when you need a larger range than byte but still want to conserve memory.
Example: short distance = 3000;

long:
Use for very large whole numbers.
Example: long population = 7000000000L;

double:
Use for floating-point numbers when higher precision is required.
Example: double pi = 3.14159265359;

String:
Use for storing sequences of characters or text.
Example: String greeting = "Hello, World!";
